# remontas24.ru
## introduction
My legacy project. It was made in 2016 by me and my friend Krishtalev Alexander.

## description
Web site to search for contractors in Russia for construction and repair work. Users are people who want to make repairs in their apartment. To do this, they are looking for contractor. But in order to select the contractor you want to compare it with other. Remontas24 will help to do this and make the best choice.

## Using technologies
Python bottle.py, Angular 1, MongoDB

## features
* JWT authorisation
* watermarks on uploaded photos
* contractors search algorithm

## what I would have done differently
* for backend use something like django or node.js
* for frontend use Vue.js or React
* use docker
* use webpack
* npm instead bower

## conclusion
It was good expirience.
